# Welcome!

Running demo: http://www.ellipsetours.com/Demos/geolocation/

# To Do

* Draw a line to show your travel
* Indicator while loading initial location
* Show current speed and the total distance traveled. The haversine forumla in the code should make that pretty easy. Jim can help with this.
* Prettier "failed to load map" indicator; don't show to user while still loading map
* prettier aside
* Use createPolygonAroundPoint
