# To Do

1. User clicks a point - the pushpin shows and the server is pinged to get the address from Bing Map Services via WCF proxy.
2. User clicks another point and the same things happens.
3. With two addresses and points, the client makes a call to get the route between those two addresses and displays it in a div.
4. User clicks another point and the route is cleared - restart at #1.
