# Welcome!

Running demo: http://www.ellipsetours.com/Demos/geolocation/

# To Do

* Clean up mode system
* Map events aren't getting removed properly
* Beautify code
* Draw a line to show your travel
* Other readouts about your location?
* Better fallbacks and error handling for geolocation?
* Indicator while loading initial location
* Show current speed and the total distance traveled. The haversine forumla in the code should make that pretty easy. Jim can help with this.
* Hide API key
