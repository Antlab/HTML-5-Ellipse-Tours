# Planned Demos

* Canvas: flying lines screen-saver
* Geolocation: a web app that watches your location as you walk around and draws out the trail you make
* Web workers: rendering a fractal while simultaneously allowing you to navigate around it
* History: How about a page with four areas of content arranged in a grid. Click on one and it zooms up to fill the screen, pushing itself into the history. You can then hit back to get to the grid, etc. 
* Web sockets: chat app
* Offline access: Calculator that you can use when not connected
* Local storage: something with preference setting that get remembered. 
* Web messaging: can this be used to keep two web pages up to sync with each other? If so, we could do something where you modify one page and it updates in the other. 
* Drag/drop: played between three web pages
* Forms API: restaurant reservation/takeout order system. 
* You forgot audio and video: we could do some simple player UIs
