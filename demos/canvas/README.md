# TODO: 

* Either handle resize better (for instance, make sure the lines are inside the new w/h, since our bounce logic is kind of lame) or just let it scale without explicitly resizing
* Image drawing
* Text drawing
* Transforms
* At least on Firefox, it never erases fully.
* Test on various browsers
* Use exCanvas or some such?
