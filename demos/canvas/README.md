# TODO: 

* At least on Firefox, it never erases fully. Probably not a big deal
* Test on various browsers
* Use exCanvas or some such?
* Use additional canvas features? See http://simon.html5.org/dump/html5-canvas-cheat-sheet.html
* Should do something with direct pixel manipulation, at least

# Comments from Jim:

Any way to include more info related to images, shapes, text etc for Canvas? I was hoping that we could make each chapter's subject matter pretty definitive. Certainly not game-developer level but including as much of the current API implementation as possible.
 
Perhaps a left panel that allows you to edit properties and add/edit elements on the canvas?
