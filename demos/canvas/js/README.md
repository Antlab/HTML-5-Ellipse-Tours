# Welcome!

[Jim Jackson II](http://twitter.com/#!/axshon) is writing a book on HTML5, aimed at .NET developers who are new to JavaScript, and [Ian Gilman](http://iangilman.com/) is writing the JavaScript sample code. 

This file ([main.js](https://github.com/axshon/HTML-5-Ellipse-Tours/blob/master/demos/canvas/js/main.js)) is a basic demo of how to use the HTML canvas ([see it in action](http://ellipsetours.com/canvas/index.html)).

What do you think about the code? Clear? Useful? Best practices? Let Ian know:
