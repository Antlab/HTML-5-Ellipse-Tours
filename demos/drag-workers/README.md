# Welcome!

Running demo: http://www.ellipsetours.com/Demos/drag-workers/

# To Do

* Learn more about file reader
* Improve effects and add 1 more
* Clean up code
* Use $container instead of $(this)?
* Prettier drop target display; use class
* When we get image size, use just the properties we need
* Actually shrink the image properly to fit
* Need to handle resize somehow? 
* Self confusion in the worker
* The worker message handler should just pass directly through
* Better name for worker object than Main
* More consistent name for page object
* Sometimes the drop target color change leaves too soonâ€¦ go back to using "over"?
* What if multiple URIs in uri-list?
* handle security error when dragging from another site
* There's no file reader in Safari
* Explanatory text?
