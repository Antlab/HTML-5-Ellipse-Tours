# Welcome!

Running demo: http://www.ellipsetours.com/Demos/drag-workers/

# To Do

* Learn more about file reader
* Be able to drag images within the page (and from other pages?)
* More Web workers (blur, lighten, sharpen, find edges)
* Clean up code
* Use $container instead of $(this)?
* Prettier drop target display
* When we get image size, use just the properties we need
* Actually shrink the image properly to fit
* Need to handle resize somehow? 
* Self confusion in the worker
* The worker message handler should just pass directly through
* Better name for worker object than Main
* More consistent name for page object
* Sometimes the drop target color change leaves too soonâ€¦ go back to using "over"?
